# CS350A Assignment 2

This is the repository for assignment 2 of CS350A: Principles of Programming Languages, offered in the odd semester of 2019.
The goal is to build an interpreter for the kernel language of the [Oz](https://mozart.github.io) programming language, given its AST.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+

## Instructions
1. Choose a testcase from the "testcases" directory.
2. Run the interpreter as follows:

./run.py conditionals_1
```
