# CS350A Assignment 2 & 3

This is the repository for assignment 2 & 3 of CS350A: Principles of Programming Languages, offered in the odd semester of 2019.
The goal is to build an interpreter for the kernel language of the [Oz](https://mozart.github.io) programming language, given its AST.
This supports the declarative concurrent model (lazy execution is not supported).
